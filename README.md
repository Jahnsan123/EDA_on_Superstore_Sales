# Superstore Sales Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Superstore Sales dataset. The Superstore Sales dataset is a fictional dataset often used for data analysis and visualization practice.

## Overview

In this project, I performed an EDA on the Superstore Sales dataset to gain insights into the sales data and uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and summary statistics.

## Dataset

The Superstore Sales dataset used in this project can be found on my profile. It includes information about sales transactions, such as order date, product category, quantity sold, sales revenue, and more.

## Analysis

The EDA process includes the following steps:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to explore the data, such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.
- Summary Statistics: Calculating descriptive statistics to summarize the data.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
